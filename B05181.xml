            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And considering the danger our Borders are in of ane invasion from the Sectaries and their adherents in <hi>England,</hi> who have presently considerable numbers of forces in the North. And may upon a sudden invade this Kingdom, to the disturbance of the Peace thereof, and the prejudice of the present under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of this Kingdome, in pursuance of the ends of the Solemn League and Covenant, Have thought fit for the reasons foresaids, to appoint the just equall half of the last proportion of Horse, to be presently levied forth of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Shires of this Kingdom. And for that effect Ordains the Committee of War of the severall Shires, to cause the Heritors, proper Woodsetters, Life-renters, and others sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

And these benorth <hi>Spey</hi> upon the 22. day of the same moneth. And Ordains the saids Colonels and Committees in every Shire to have their proportions of Horse armed and provided as aforesaid, at the place of Randevouse, and at the diets <hi>respective</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, to march according to such orders as shall be then sent to them, under the penaltie aforesaid.

And farther the saids Committee declares, that the Heretors and others foresaids, failing in their proportions, shall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed as enemies to, and hinderers of the publick service of the Kingdom, in pursuance of the ends of the Covenant, and disaffected persons to the preservation of Religion, of the Prince his Highnes Person, the safety of the Kingdome.

And if the Committees of the Shires be remisse in their meetings, or in putting their orders to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, that the Colonels with such of the Committee as are willing to joyn with them, conveen upon al occasions for putting their orders to execution, and for doing every thing that may further this present Levie, being alwayes compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their proceedings to the Committee of Estates. And if any person or persons, of what degree, qualitie or condition soever, shall offer to oppose or obstruct by violence the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Committee of Estates, with power to the saids Committees and Colonels, to use all meanes to compose them, and if need be, to pursue the raisers of the tumults, and the publick opposers of the resolutions of the Committee in a hostile way by the strength of the Shire: And if the insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or opposition come to that height, that the Shire where it falls out is not able to suppresse the same, That the Committees, Colonels and Commanders of the next adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Shires on all quarters, joyn for suppressing thereof, as they shall receive advertisement. And that the saids Forces may be kept in the better order and discipline, The said Committee ordains all Officers constantly to attend their charge, and that none of them upon any pretext whatsoever, be absent the space of three dayes, without waarrand. With certification to the contraveeners hereof, that their places shall be declared vacand, and another established in their charge. And the Committee of Estates declares, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Officer or Souldier shall be found guiltie of taking at
